# Android Music Player

> For this week challenge I built a Music Player using spotify as a UI reference. It handles play/pause song, next/prev song, a dynamic seekbar, dynamic timestamps and an options menu to look for the bands details. It keeps playing on the background when the app is not on focus.

## Built with

- Kotlin
- Android Studio
- Jetpack

## What I learned

- To create constraints layouts
- To use Media Player class
- Life Cycles in fragments
- Navigate between fragments
- Data Binding
